## Point out an error

For the question that **"Why is Thread instead of Process in ‘4 Core 8 Thread' ?”** in PDF

Firstly，a point should be clearly，which is that **Thread in '4 Core 8 Thread' is different with Thread in operating system**.The former refers to the **physical unit** in the CPU, the latter refers to the **logical unit** in the operating system, so the problem does not hold!
